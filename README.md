Tech Degree Unit 9 Project
# Proximity Reminders

This app was created for Unit 9 of my Treehouse iOS/Swift Tech Degree. I used various technologies like Core Data, Core Location and the User Notifications framework.

The Brief
> Create an iOS app that provides location-specific reminders: have your phone remind you to pick up milk when you enter the market, or remind you to lock the door when you leave your house. Use Core Data to save the reminders and Core Location for geo-fencing and reminder notifications.

End Result
